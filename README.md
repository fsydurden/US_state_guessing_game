U.S. States Guessing Game üó∫Ô∏è
Welcome to the U.S. States Guessing Game! This is a fun and educational game that challenges you to name all 50 states of the United States. It's built with Python and the turtle module to create an interactive map-based experience.

üöÄ Features
Interactive Map: A map of the U.S. is displayed, and correctly guessed states appear on it.

Guess the States: Enter the name of a state in the pop-up dialog box.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of how many states you've correctly identified out of 50.

Learn From Your Misses: When you finish the game or type exit, a states_to_learn.csv file is automatically generated. This file contains a list of all the states you missed, so you know what to study for next time!

üéÆ How to Get Started
Follow these simple steps to get the game running on your local machine.

üìù remaining_states.csv File
Don't worry if you can't name all 50 states on your first try! When you're done playing (either by guessing all the states or by typing exit), the game will create a new file in the project folder called states_to_learn.csv.

This file lists all the states you didn't guess, making it a perfect study guide for your next attempt.

Happy guessing!
